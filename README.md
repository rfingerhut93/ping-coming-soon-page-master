# Ping Coming Soon Page

This is a simple coming soon page template called "Ping" designed for Frontend Mentor. It features a subscription form where users can enter their email addresses to get notified when a new product or website launches. If an invalid email is entered, the input field is highlighted in red, and an error message is displayed.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the Ping coming soon page.

3. To customize the page's content, styles, or functionality, you can modify the HTML, CSS (located in the `styles.css` file), and JavaScript (located in the `app.js` file) files as needed.

4. If you want to make changes to the email validation script, you can find the relevant JavaScript code in the `app.js` file. The script validates email addresses when the user submits the form and clears the input field when a valid email is entered.

5. Feel free to replace the social media links, images, and other content with your own to suit your project's needs.
